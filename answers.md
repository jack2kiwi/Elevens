1. What is the range of win percentages that you saw? Were the percentages fairly consistent, or did they vary quite a bit?

    I found that the range of win percentages were 0% - 30%, this set of data varies a lot.

2. Increase the number of games to play to 100. Are the win percentages more consistent from run to run?

    With 100 games playing the win percentages were much more consistent, they were within 9% rather than 30%.
    
3. How many games do you need to play in order to get consistent results from run to run?

    While playing 1000 games you get results within 1% of eachother, but you can get even better than that at 100000 games when the variation is a measely .2%.
